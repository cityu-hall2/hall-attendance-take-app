# Getting Started With Android Development

Just like the swift guide, this guide is for those who have no programming experience. In case you find Java difficult to understand, you can refer to the Swift tutorial as a reference. The methodology of writing code is the same, it is only the syntax that differ (not by much).

## Android Studio
Android Studio is the official software provided by Google to help us develop Android Apps. You can catch up on concepts while we keep you updated on the development process. Feel free to contact us in case you need any sort of assistance.

Here is a really basic introductory course for Android Development.

## JAVA Programming Language
JAVA is the language that will be used for Android App Development. If you have time, you can refer to the following links to learn Java.

Furthemore, try to focus on the topics highlighted in the [Swift PDF](1.%20learn%20Swift%20language/Reading%201_%20Intro%20to%20Swift.pdf)
